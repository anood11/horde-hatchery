The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first release candidate of the Nag
Task List Manager version H3 (2.2).

Nag is a web-based application built upon the Horde Application Framework which
provides a simple, clean interface for managing online task lists (i.e., TODO
lists).  It also includes strong integration with the other Horde applications
and offers shared task lists.

This is a preview version that should not be used on production systems. This
version is considered feature complete but a few bugs may still exist in the
code.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system.  Updated translations are very welcome, though some strings
might still change before the final release.

The major changes compared to the Nag version H3 (2.2-ALPHA) are:
    * Added WebDAV support for external calendar clients.
    * Improved estimation times display.
    * Further bugfixes and improvements.
