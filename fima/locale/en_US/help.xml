<entry id="accounts-overview">
	<title>Accounts: Overview</title>
	<para>
	The table of accounts is structured in three levels: 
	</para>
	<heading>Account Types</heading>
	<para>
	Account types are the general aggregation of different accounts. Each account is assigned one single type. There are three different account types:
	</para>
	<para>* income (eg. salary, prizes, donations, etc.)</para>
	<para>* expense (eg. food, rental, clothes, etc.)</para>
    <para>* asset (eg. cash, credit card, bankbook, etc.)</para>
    <para>
	It is necessary to specify an asset account for each posting transaction. This way it is possible to track your assets and money transfers as well (postings from an asset account to another one).
	</para>
	<tip>
	Tip: If you are interested in your incomes and expenses only and don&apos;t want to manage any assets, create only one single asset account that will be automatically used for all postings.
	</tip>
	<heading>Account groups, Main Accounts, Subaccounts</heading>
	<para>
	An account is an aggregation of similar types of income, expense or asset positions. An account is defined by its four digit number, a name and an account type. The account number is devided into two parts: XXYY, where XX refers to the account group and YY to the subaccount (eg. in the account group 12: 1200 is the main account, 1230 and 1245 are both subaccounts). It is possible to create 100 account groups each having 100 accounts, whereas the usage of subaccounts is not necessary.
	</para>
	<para>
	Additionally it is possible to save a long description for each account and select whether postings for this account should be marked e.o. by default (see <ref module="fima" entry="postings-overview">Postings Overview</ref>). Also an account may be closed in order to prevent new postings but keep existing ones.
	</para>
	<tip>
	Tip: When using subaccounts avoid posting to the main account XX00, since it won&apos;t be possible to identify these postings in reports when aggregated to account groups. It is recommended to create a separate subaccount for general postings that don&apos;t fit into any subaccount (eg. XX99).
	</tip>
</entry>	

<entry id="accounts-delete">
	<title>Accounts: Deleting an Account</title>
	<para>
	When deleting an account you need to specify how to handle postings:
	</para>
	<para>* Delete postings: delete all existing postings that were posted to the specific account</para>
	<para>* Shift postings: move all existing postings to another account of the same account type</para>
	<para>
	Also you need to specify how to handle potential subaccounts and their postings:
	</para>
	<para>* Keep subaccounts and postings: don&apos;t do anything</para>
	<para>* Delete subaccounts and postings: delete all existing subaccounts and postings too</para>
	<para>* Delete subaccounts and shift postings: delete all existing subaccounts and previously shift any existing postings to another account of the same account type</para>
</entry>

<entry id="postings-overview">
	<title>Postings: Overview</title>
	<para>
	A posting record has of the following attributes:
	</para>
	<para>* Posting types: see <ref module="fima" entry="postings-postingtypes">Posting Types</ref></para>
	<para>* Date: date of the posting (day, month, year)</para>
	<para>* Asset account: specifying the asset account for each posting is necessary to track your assets</para>
	<para>* Posting account: the account for the transaction, usually of the type income or expense; when shifting assets (eg. draw cash from an bank account) you need to choose the appropriate asset account as posting account</para>
	<para>* Description: it is possible to enter a short description for each posting (max. 255 characters)</para>
	<para>* Amount: positive amounts increase and negative amounts decrease the chosen asset account</para>
	<para>* e.o.: postings may be marked extraordinary (very large, not planned, ...)</para>
</entry>

<entry id="postings-postingtypes">
	<title>Postings: Posting Types</title>
	<para>
	Each posting is assigned one single type. There are three different posting types:
	</para>
	<heading>Actual</heading>
	<para>
	Actual postings constist of current incomes and expenses which can be analyzed using different reports. It reflects your actual financial situation. 
	</para>
	<tip>
	Tip: Always check for asset differences before starting entering new postings. Book any differences to a specific account to guarantee at least correct asset accounts. Also check any bank account statements for missing postings.
	</tip>
	<tip>
	Tip: Try to enter your postings on a regular basis. Always ask for a sales receipt or write down the expense on a piece of paper, so you won&apos;t forget any expenses when not entereing postings immediately.
	</tip>
	<heading>Budget</heading>
	<para>
	Using a budget is optional and offers control of your future financial development as well as analyzing your former financial objectives. This way it is possible to identify your financial scope early.
	</para>
	<tip>
	Tip: Try to follow your main budget objectives. However, don&apos; stick to them at all cost, since there will be incidents that won&apos;t be included in your budget.
	</tip>
	<tip>
	Tip: If you use a detailed table of accounts, create your budget based on main accounts instead of subaccounts since it would be very time-consuming otherwise.
	</tip>
	<tip>
	Tip: Enter any differences between your actual and budget to your budget. This way also your budget assets are up-to-date.
	</tip>
	<tip>
	Tip: It is possible to create your budget based on the postings of the last year by copying and optionally summarize them using the <ref module="fima" entry="postings-transfer">Transfer Postings</ref> functionality and adapting it afterwards.
	</tip>
	<heading>Forecast</heading>
	<para>
	After creating a budget it usually won&apos;t change. All further adaptions can be included in the forecast which therefore is an updated budget.
	</para>
	<tip> 
	Tip: Check for any differences between your actual and budget/forecast result regularly and adapt your future forecast.
	</tip>
	<tip>
	Tip: Enter any differences between your actual and forcast to your budget. This way also your forecast assets are up-to-date.
	</tip>
	<tip>
	Tip: It is possible to create your forecast by copying your budget using the <ref module="fima" entry="postings-transfer">Transfer Postings</ref> functionality and afterwards adapting it afterwards.
	</tip>
</entry>

<entry id="postings-addedit">
	<title>Postings: Add/Edit Postings</title>
	<para>
	When adding new postings the date and asset account will be copied from the entry above for convenience, but may be changed later on.
	</para>
	<para>
	Expenses usually are negative amounts, but may be entered without negative sign for convenience (see <ref module="fima" entry="fima-options">Interface Options: Enter expenses with negative sign?</ref>). However, when shifting assets (transfer from one asset account to another one) the entered value always applies to the selected asset account (eg. -10 means a decrease of the selected asset account by 10 and subsequently an increase by 10 of the asset account selected as posting account).
	</para>
	<tip>
	Tip: When entering new postings, it is possible to select accounts by simply typing the account number on the keyboard instead of browsing through the drop down field. In a short time you will know the most used account numbers and it will save you a lot of time entering new postings.
	</tip>
	<tip>
	Tip: When entering new postings, it is possible to execute mathematical operations in the amount field. Simply type the mathematical expression (eg. 3+2*5) and the result will automatically be calculated.
	</tip>
	<tip>
	Tip: In order to prevent adding or editing postings with a date in the past unintentionally, enter a closing period (see <ref module="fima" entry="fima-options">Options: Active Configuration: Closed by period</ref>).
	</tip>
	<tip>
	Tip: When entering new postings for <ref module="fima" entry="postings-postingtypes">budget or forecast</ref>, it is possible to automatically create a set of similar postings for each month of a specific year. In the first row enter any date in the desired year, choose an asset and posting account and enter a description (optionally) and amount. Then press the button &quot;Autofill&quot; to copy the entered values down for alle months.
	</tip>

<entry id="postings-shift">
	<title>Postings: Shift Postings</title>
	<para>
	Shift several selected postings in order to move them to another posting type or to change the asset or posting account all at once.
	</para>
</entry>

<entry id="postings-transfer">
	<title>Postings: Transfer Postings</title>
	<para>
	Transfer all postings of a specific posting type within a specific period to another posting type using the following options:
	</para>
	<para>* Transfer from: source posting type where to transfer posting from</para>

	<para>* Period to: destination period of posting to transfer to</para>
	<para>* Delete existing Postings: previously delete any existing postings of the destination posting type within the destination period</para>
	<tip>
	Tip: You may create a <ref module="fima" entry="postings-postingtypes">budget (or forecast)</ref> by transfering existing posting from actual (or budget). Don&apos;t forget to keep the original posting. It is recommended to summarize postings for a budget (or forecast) to have postings on main account level only. This way it is easier to make adaptions later.
	</tip>
	<tip>
	Tip: It is possible to transfer all postings of a year at once. Select &quot;All&quot; as source and destination month in order to keep the posting month unchanged.
