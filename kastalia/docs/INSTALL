This document contains instructions for installing the Kastalia download application

For information on the capabilities and features of Kastalia, see the file
README_ in the top-level directory of the Kastalia distribution.


Obtaining Kastalia
==================

Kastalia can be obtained from the authors website

   http://h4des.org/index.php?inhalt=kastalia


Prerequisites
=============

To function properly, Kastalia **requires** the following:

1. A working Horde installation.

   Kastalia runs within the `Horde Application Framework`_, a set of common
   tools for Web applications written in PHP. You must install Horde before
   installing Kastalia.

   .. Important:: Kastalia 1.0 requires version 3.0+ of the Horde Framework -
                  earlier versions of Horde will **not** work.

   .. _`Horde Application Framework`: http://www.horde.org/horde/

   The Horde Framework can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server,
   at

      http://www.horde.org/horde/

      ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/horde/

   Many of Kastalia's prerequisites are also Horde prerequisites.

   .. Important:: Be sure to have completed all of the steps in the
                  `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ file for the Horde Framework before
                  installing Kastalia.

2. Install the MCrypt module for php. (optional)

   Kastalia uses the MCrypt module for php to encrypt/decrypt files on the 
   server. If you want to store files encrypted on the server you have to
   install this module.

   For further informations and to get MCrypt take a look at

   http://mcrypt.sourceforge.net/

   and

   http://php.net/manual/en/mcrypt.setup.php


Installing Kastalia
===================

Kastalia is written in PHP, and must be installed in a web-accessible
directory. The precise location of this directory will differ from system to
system. Kastalia must be installed directly underneath Horde in the
web server's document tree.

Since Kastalia is written in PHP, there is no compilation necessary; simply
expand the distribution where you want it to reside and rename the root
directory of the distribution to whatever you wish to appear in the URL. For
example, with the Apache web server's default document root of
``/usr/local/apache/htdocs``, you would type::

   cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs/horde
   tar zxvf /path/to/kastalia-1.0.tar.gz
   mv kastalia-1.0 kastalia

and would then find Kastalia at the URL::

   http://your-server/horde/kastalia/


Configuring Kastalia
====================

1. Configuring Horde for Kastalia

   Register the application

      In ``horde/config/registry.php``, add the following lines:

      $this->applications['kastalia'] = array(
          'fileroot' => dirname(__FILE__) . '/../kastalia',
          'webroot' => $this->applications['horde']['webroot'] . '/kastalia',
          'name' => _("Datastore"),
          'status' => 'active',
      );

      $this->applications['kastalia-menu'] = array(
          'status' => 'block',
          'app' => 'kastalia',
          'blockname' => 'tree_menu',
          'menu_parent' => 'kastalia',
      );

2. Configuring Kastalia

   You must login to Horde as a Horde Administrator to finish the
   configuration of Kastalia. Use the Horde ``Administration`` menu item to
   get to the administration page, and then click on the ``Configuration``
   icon to get the configuration page. Select ``Datastore`` from the
   selection list of applications. Fill in or change any configuration values
   as needed. When done click on ``Generate Kastalia Name Configuration`` to
   generate the ``conf.php`` file. If your web server doesn't have write
   permissions to the Kastalia configuration directory or file, it will not be
   able to write the file. In this case, go back to ``Configuration`` and
   choose one of the other methods to create the configuration file
   ``kastalia/config/conf.php``.

   Note for international users: Kastalia uses GNU gettext to provide local
   translations of text displayed by applications; the translations are found
   in the ``po/`` directory. If a translation is not yet available for your
   locale (and you wish to create one), see the ``horde/po/README`` file, or
   if you're having trouble using a provided translation, please see the
   `horde/docs/TRANSLATIONS`_ file for instructions.

3. Securing Kastalia

   Before you can secure Kastalia, you need a secure Horde installation.  Please
   read the file in `horde/docs/SECURITY`_ for Horde security information
   before proceeding.

   First you have to realize that every directory bellow your chosen Kastalia
   datastore will be downloadable with Kastalia. So if you choose the directory
   ``/`` every authorized Horde user can download everything readable
   from your server. The next point to secure your datastore is to place it
   outside the webroot for example ``/srv/kastalia/datastore``. If you
   do so, make the directory readable by the webserver and the files owned by
   ``root``. If your webserver runs as ``www.www``, do as follows:

      chown root:www kastalia/datastore/*
      chmod 440 kastalia/datastore/*

   An additional approach is to make Kastalia's configuration files owned by the
   user ``root`` and by a group which only the webserver user belongs to, and
   then making them readable only to owner and group.  For example, if your
   webserver runs as ``www.www``, do as follows:

      chown root.www config/*
      chmod 440 config/*

   To ensure you have a secure file sharing application you should use _https_
   instead of http. We also recomment to use the option to store files encrypted 
   (Prerequisites: 2. Install the MCrypt module for php).

5. Testing Kastalia

   Once you have configured Kastalia, you can click on the ``Datastore`` link
   in the Horde menu. Kastalia will immediately list every file in the configured
   datastore. Clicking on a file will start the download.
