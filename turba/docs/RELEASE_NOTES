The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first release candidate of the Turba
Contact Manager version H3 (2.2).

Turba is the Horde contact management application. It is a production level
address book, and makes heavy use of the Horde framework to provide
integration with IMP and other Horde applications. It supports SQL, LDAP,
Kolab, and IMSP address books.

This is a preview version that should not be used on production systems. This
version is considered feature complete but a few bugs may still exist in the
code.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system.  Updated translations are very welcome, though some strings
might still change before the final release.

The major changes compared to the Turba version H3 (2.2-ALPHA) are:
    * Improved default address book scheme.
    * Improved vCard support.
    * Improved birthday support.
    * Further bugfixes and improvements.
