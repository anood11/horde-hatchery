The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first release candidate of the Ingo
Email Filter Rules Manager version H3 (1.2).

Ingo is an email-filter management application. It is fully internationalized,
integrated with Horde and the IMP Webmail client, and supports both
server-side (Sieve, procmail) and client-side (IMAP) rule creation.

This is a preview version that should not be used on production systems. This
version is considered feature complete but a few bugs may still exist in the
code.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system.  Updated translations are very welcome, though some strings
might still change before the final release.

The major changes compared to the Ingo version H3 (1.2-ALPHA) are:
    * Added a Postfix policy daemon for blacklists and whitelists.
    * Several improvements to the IMAP, Sieve, and Maildrop drivers.
    * Added Japanese translation.
    * Further bugfixes and improvements.
